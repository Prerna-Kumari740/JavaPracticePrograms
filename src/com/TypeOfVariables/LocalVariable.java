// all primitive type data are available in the form of keywords
// java has total 8 primitive data type

// non -primitive type data in java also called user defined type data because user can also create different type of  non- primitive type data 


// if a variable is inside method block , constructor block or any block  which is after class block then it is called a local variable.
// in other words variable not directly inside class block

// A local variable and global can exist with same name  the preference is given to a local variable and global became hidden which is called  variable hidding we can overcome var hidding by using class reference in case of static variable  and object reference in case of non-static variable
